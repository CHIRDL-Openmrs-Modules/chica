* export the patient table from chica1.0 to a comma delimited file called chica1_patient.csv. Similarly, export the chica1.0 patient_obsv table to chica1_patient_obsv.csv, the chica1.0 appointments table to chica1_appointments.csv, the chica1.0 obsv_dictionary table to chica1_obsv_dictionary.csv, and the chica1.0 vitals_obsv_dictionary table to vitals_obsv_dictionary.csv. Make sure to export WITHOUT column names.

* edit the file paths in loader.sql to point to the correct file paths for the csv files.

* run the following to import the csv files into the openmrs tables that contain the chica1.0 data (chica1_appointments, chica1_patient, chica1_patient_obsv, chica1_obsv_dictionary):

open a mysql prompt
enter the root password
type "use openmrs;"
type "source loader.sql;"

You might receive warnings about duplicates. Just ignore these.

* to load the chica1.0 information into chica2.0, do the following:

- login to openmrs
- Go to the Administration tab
- Click on Load old obs
- Enter an optional start and end date for the load. If the dates are empty, all obs will be loaded.
- Click on Load Obs
- It will take quite awhile for this to run (3+ hours). There are flags in the chica1_* tables that mark which patients, obs, appointments have already been loaded so they will not be loaded again.
- After the load is finished, you can check each chica_* table to see which obs were loaded. There is an id called openmrs_obs_id, etc that will have the id of the actual openmrs table row that was created.
- Run the following query to monitor the encounters created by load obs:

select * from encounter 
where  provider_id=(select user_id from users where username='.Other')
order by date_created desc

- Run the following queries to monitor the chica1_* tables. These queries will show you the rows from the tables that haven't been loaded:

select * from chica1_appointments where openmrs_encounter_id is null and skip_load_reason is null

select * from chica1_patient where openmrs_patient_id is null and skip_load_reason is null

select * from chica1_patient_obsv where openmrs_obs_id is null and skip_load_reason is null
and obsv_source not in ('PWS ID: 24382') and obsv_source not in ('Corrected-Asthma-Study')
