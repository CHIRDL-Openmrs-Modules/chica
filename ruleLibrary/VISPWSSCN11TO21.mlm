	Purpose:		The following rule will remind physicians to perform a vision screening examination via the PWS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;;
	Explanation:	According to the AAP periodicity guidelines, children between 11 and 21 should have their vision tested objectively, via examination every three years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;;
