	Purpose:		If a patient is classified as having persistant asthma and is having significant symptoms reported on PSF, this alerts physicnain and suggests considering adherance, second controller, or referral                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;;
	Explanation:	If asthma status is persistent and patient reported any significant symptoms in the last month, this PWS alerts MD                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ;;
