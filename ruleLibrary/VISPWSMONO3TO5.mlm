	Purpose:		The following rule will alert practitioners that the corresponding 3-5 year old failed vision screening by monocular criteria and suggest a optho referral.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;;
	Explanation:	According to the AAP visual screening policy statement, referrals are recommended for all children 3-5 who show a greater than 20/40 deficit monocularly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ;;
