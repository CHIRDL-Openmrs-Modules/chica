	Purpose:		The following rule will alert practitioners that the corresponding 5-21 year old failed vision screening by monocular criteria and suggest a ophtho referral.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;;
	Explanation:	According to the AAP visual screening policy statement, referrals are recommended for all children 5-21 who show a greater than 20/30 deficit monocularly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ;;
