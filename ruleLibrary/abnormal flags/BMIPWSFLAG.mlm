	Purpose:		Flags BMI as being abnormal on PWS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;;
	Explanation:	Abnormal criteria are less than the 5th percentile and greater than the 95th percentile for age.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ;;
