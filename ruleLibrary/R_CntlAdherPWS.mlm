	Purpose:		In patients who are thought to be on controller meds, but deny using a medication every day on the PSF, alerts the MD that there may be an adherenc problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;;
	Explanation:	If AsthmaStatus is Persistent-non-adherent, PWS is printed and MD can indicate if compliance is a problem or not, or if the asthma status is different (e.g., intermittent)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;;
