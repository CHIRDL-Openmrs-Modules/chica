	Purpose:		Assess whether symptoms limit normal activity in patients with known asthma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;;
	Explanation:	If a patient is known to the system to have asthma, this PSF asks if symptoms interfere with normal activities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ;;
