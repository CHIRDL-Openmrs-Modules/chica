	Purpose:		This is the third screening question about school performance from the GAPS handbook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ;;
	Explanation:	School performance is one of the most sensitive markers of psychosocial adjustment to adolescence.  Assessing this is not easy or simple.  This PSF asks a simple screening question from the GAPS handbook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ;;
