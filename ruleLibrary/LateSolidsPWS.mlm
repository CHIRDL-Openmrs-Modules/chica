	Purpose:		This question will screen whether an infant is being fed solid food.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ;;
	Explanation:	Recommendations state that solids should not be introduced until an infant is 4 months old.  Between 4-6 months the introduction of single grain cereals, like rice cereal, is a good idea.  After that, pureed foods can be introduced, one every few days to look for allergic reactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ;;
