	Purpose:		This PWS advises clinicians on how to administer age-appropriate advice on choking and poisoning prevention to parents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ;;
	Explanation:	The AAP has a number of recommendations to prevent childhood choking and poisoning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ;;
